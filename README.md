# fr-communes
[XYZ map tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiled_web_map) covering [ country: France / areas : communes]  
this repository tiles may be used to design thematic maps with map-scribble web app 

## What's that ?
map-scribble, available at [Github Pages](https://mbenzekri.github.io/scribble-map/),
is an app to define thematic maps, more precisely Chloropleth (Wikipedia: [Thematic maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_map).

For short a chloropleth is a map, made of polygon areas, each area is filled with a color depending on a statistic value,
for example: population density, earthcake frequency, votes, disease frequency ...

## Available data  
* areas in this XYZ tiles repository represent all 'communes' (towns) from 'FRANCE'  
* key identifier for "communes" is commonly used french 'CODE INSEE' (administrative codification) 

If you project to build a scribble-map with this data you must provide a csv file with a column containing 
this key (CODE INSEE) in order to have a successful mapping for your area <=> colors.
